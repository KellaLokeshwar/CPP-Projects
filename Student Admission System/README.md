# Student Admission System
In this system, we are using C++ programming to perform the operations required in the Student Admission. Here, we are using a Class Student where we have instances like "rollno","age" and "age".

## Some of the Operations are :
1. Adding the Student Details
2. Displaying all the Student Details
3. Searching the Student Details
4. Updating atleast one of the instances of a Student
5. Exiting from the Student Admission System.

All these operations are carrying out by the User's choice. And according to C++, we can make use of our choice by "Switch" statement.

This is the basic level implementation of the C++ program using the OOPS concept.
