# Student Admission System
In this system, we are using C++ programming to perform the operations required in the Student Admission. Here, we are using a Class Student where we have instances like "rollno","age" and "age".

## Some of the Operations are :
1. Adding the Student Details
2. Displaying all the Student Details
3. Searching the Student Details
4. Updating atleast one of the instances of a Student
5. Exiting from the Student Admission System.

All these operations are carrying out by the User's choice. And according to C++, we can make use of our choice by "Switch" statement. The program effectively demonstrates encapsulation and abstraction through the use of the "Student" class.

"Encapsulation" is achieved by bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, the Student class. Access to the data is restricted using private access specifiers, and public getter and setter methods are provided to interact with the data.

"Abstraction" is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. The Student class abstracts the details of a student, providing a simple interface for interacting with student objects without needing to know the underlying implementation.

This is the basic level implementation of the C++ program using the OOPS concept.
